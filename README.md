# BeerOrCoffeChallenge
My project iOS developed in Swift

**Libraries Used:**

- MapKit to perform search locations (native);
- CoreLocation to use current local user (native);
- Alamofire is an HTTP networking library.

CocoaPods was used for installation of library Alamofire and the internet connection is required for the app.
